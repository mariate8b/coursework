    <p>Giraffes, the tallest mammals on Earth, are a common sight on the savannas of Africa.

        As Tanzania’s national animal, the giraffe is revered and protected within the country’s borders. The animal represents the ability to be visionary – seeing the past and the present. And so, the giraffe serves as a reminder for Tanzanians to view life from all angles.</p>
